# Code of Conduct Spring 2023

It is my intent that students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. I will gladly honor your request to address you by the name and pronoun you specify. I commit to make individual arrangements to address disabilities or religious needs; please advise me of these early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my plans and records.
