# Class 3
FEBRUARY 6

## Lecture: Eagle Schematics

Following along with the [Eagle Schematic Design - 1](https://homemadehardware.com/guides/eagle-schematic-design-1) guide.

## Lecture: Eagle Board Design

Following along with the [Eagle Board Design - 1 guide](https://homemadehardware.com/guides/eagle-board-design-1). This includes the ability to import a design from Illustrator, so that you can design your board's layout in a software better suited for drawing and fonts.

## Homework for next class

* Finish the Eagle design of your [Marquee letter](../week02-programming-attiny85/MARQUEE.md) (TBD):

* Export a PDF of your design, and post to your blog.
* Order all materials required for milling, from the [Things/Materials](https://homemadehardware.com/things) page. These include:
  * Endmill and engraving bits (I recommend getting x2 of each type)
  * Double-sided tape (the "permanent" type)
  * Copper boards (ITP does stock these but I **STRONGLY** recommend getting some of your own and/or splitting with someone
